# API Lightning Talk

## Big Break Coming Up

So we're about to take over a week off of class, but that doesn't mean you should take over a week off from coding.  There are a lot of things you can do to stay fresh over the break, and here they are, in order:

### Catch up on HWs and Project 1 (Required)

We are going to keep charging ahead when we get back from break.  Look at all of our "Grow"s for any Incomplete HWs or Project 1.

>**Reminder:** The threshold for passing Project 1 is 42.

### Finish the TODO API HW

This is due the Tuesday we come back.  Get as far as you can, and lean on other devs for help if you're stuck./*

### Look over your old HWs to make sure you can reproduce the results

Try starting from scratch, and only look at your older work if you are stuck for more than 10 minutes.

### Look over your old lessons to make sure you know the major terms and where to look in the future

Do not worry about memorizing everything.  You can, and will, use these as a resource for Project 2, and beyond.

### Research an API you want to use in your Project 2 (Required)

Talk to your squads for about 5 minutes.  Figure out what are some cool APIs you would like to research.  

When we return after break, you will be presenting for ~2 minutes on your findings.

### CodeWars (Optional)

Go to [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) and sharpen your JS skills.  There are challenges all the way from fairly simple (level 8) to incredibly hard (level 1).  Start low, and work your way up, but don't be discouraged if a problem is way over your head.  Just skip and move on to the next one.

/* Please use #wdi6 whenever you're stuck for more than 10 minutes on any task.
